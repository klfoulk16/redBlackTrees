# Red Black Trees
The goal of this project is to properly implement and test red black tree structures in python.

You must slay the baby dragons before you tackle the real dragon. Hence I will come to understand red black trees before implementing them as my database's in-memory data storage system.

Please use this project as you see fit. My goal is to make this a project that anyone can easily look at to understand how red black trees work, how to test them. Grab the code to use for your own project if you'd like.
